# GFS-Predictions
Accessing Wind Data from the NOAA GFS Model, and using it to make balloon trajectory predictions

Uses [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)

Altitude profiles in the correct format can be created with the createAltPlan.py script.

simulator.py is a GUI-based program to download the GFS dataset for a geographic region and time range, 
as well as generate a predicted flight path based on initial conditions and an altitude profile.
